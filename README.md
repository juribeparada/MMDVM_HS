# MMDVM_HS -- MMDVM Hotspot Firmware #

## Introduction ##

This is the source code of ZUMspot/MMDVM_HS firmware for personal hotspots (ADF7021 version of the MMDVM firmware), based on Jonathan G4KLX's [MMDVM](https://github.com/g4klx/MMDVM) software. This firmware supports D-Star, DMR, System Fusion, P25 and NXDN digital voice modes and POCSAG 1200 pager protocol.

This software is intended to be run on STM32F103 microcontroller. Also, Arduino with 3.3 V I/O (Arduino Due and Zero) and Teensy (3.1, 3.2, 3.5 or 3.6) are supported. You can build this code using Arduino IDE with Roger Clark's [STM32duino](https://github.com/rogerclarkmelbourne/Arduino_STM32/tree/ZUMspot) package, or using command line tools with ARM GCC tools. The preferred method under Windows is using STM32duino, and under Linux or macOS (command line) is using [STM32F10X_Lib](https://github.com/juribeparada/STM32F10X_Lib). 

This software comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY, it is provided "AS IS" with the hope to be useful, use at your own risk. This firmware software is intended to be use into personal hotspots hardware, with a few mili-watts of RF power and short ranges (indoor). Because this is an amateur project doing by developers under their free time, and due to ADF7021 limitations, please DO NOT EXPECT high performance or full compliant to any digital voice standard of this firmware or any board based on this firmware.

This software is licenced under the GPL v2 and is intended for amateur and educational use only. Use of this software for commercial purposes is strictly forbidden.

## Known issues ##

### Common issues for simplex and duplex boards ###

- High RX BER or not RX, poor TX audio (4FSK modes): adjust frequency offset, specially RXOffset.
- Not instantaneous mode detection (2 modes or more enabled): mode detection could be slow and sometimes you need to hold PTT several seconds, in order to activate the hotspot. There is no solution for that, since ADF7021 works only one mode at once. You can disable mode scanning, enabling just one mode.
- Poor audio with MD380: increase DMR deviation to 55 % or 60 %.
- Bad RX sensitivity: this is not a firmware issue, ADF7021 has a minimum signal detection around -109 dBm in DMR, but RX performance depends on RF board design, external RX noise, frequency, etc. At the moment only original ZUMspot RPi can reach the best RX sensitivity in 70 cm band.
- Not working with RPi 3B+ (USB): be sure your firmware version is >= 1.4.8 and update to new USB bootloader with long reset pulse (make stlink-bl, for example).
- Not working with USB (not RPi 3B+): compile with "LONG_USB_RESET" option disabled, and use old bootloader (make stlink-bl-old, for example).


### Duplex boards ###

- Very difficult DMR activation ("repeater fail" error): disable mode scanning, select just DMR mode.
- Not DMR activation ("repeater fail" error) with MD380, Ailunce HD1 or some other radios: increase DMR deviation to 55 % or 60 %.
- RX timeout: this is due to TX and RX clock differences, which does not have easy solution. Be sure your firmware version is >= 1.4.7, which minimizes this problem.


## Notes for previous users of MMDVM boards ##

MMDVM_HS boards do not need deviation calibration like MMDVM boards, but could be necessary some frequency offset calibration (ADF7021 does not have AFC for 4FSK modes).

The following options in MMDVM.ini ([Modem] section) have not any effect for MMDVM_HS boards:

    TXInvert
    RXInvert
    PTTInvert
    RXLevel
    RXDCOffset
    TXDCOffset

The following options in MMDVM.ini ([Modem] section) are very important for MMDVM_HS boards:

    RXOffset: RX frequency offset (HS RX BER improvement)
    TXOffset: TX frequency offset (radio RX improvement)
    TXLevel: default deviation setting (recommended value: 50)
    RFLevel: RF power output (recommended value: 100)
    CWIdTXLevel: CW ID deviation setting (recommended value: 50)
    D-StarTXLevel: D-Star deviation setting (recommended value: 50)
    DMRTXLevel: DMR deviation setting (recommended value: 50)
    YSFTXLevel: YSF deviation setting (recommended value: 50)
    P25TXLevel: P25 deviation setting (recommended value: 50)
    NXDNTXLevel: NXDN deviation setting (recommended value: 50)
    POCSAGTXLevel: POCSAG deviation setting (recommended value: 50)


## Important notes ##

The ADF7021 (or RF7021SE module) must operate with a 14.7456 MHz TCXO and with at least 2.5 ppm of frequency stability or better. For 800-900 MHz frequency band you will need even a better frequency stability TCXO. You could use also 12.2880 MHz TCXO. Any other TCXO frequency is not supported. Please note that a bad quality TCXO not only affects the frequency offset, also affects clock data rate, which is not possible to fix and will cause BER issues.

Please set TXLevel=50 in MMDVM.ini to configure default deviation levels for all modes. You could modify this value and other TXLevel paramenters to change deviation levels. Use [MMDVMCal](https://github.com/g4klx/MMDVMCal) to check DMR deviation level and TX frequency offset with calibrated test equipment.

The jumper wire to CLKOUT in RF7021SE module is not longer required for lastest MMDVM_HS firmware. But CE pin connection of ADF7021 is required for proper operation of ZUMspot.

Be aware that some Blue Pill STM32F103 board are defectives. If you have trouble with USB, please check this [link](http://wiki.stm32duino.com/index.php?title=Blue_Pill).

VHF (144-148 MHz) support for ZUMSpot is added by an external 18 nH inductor between L1 and L2 pins of ADF7021. This will enable dual band (VHF/UHF) operation.

Dual ADF7021 for full duplex operation (#define DUPLEX in Config.h) will work only with a big RX/TX frequency separation (5 MHz or more in UHF band for example) and proper antenna filtering. At the moment #define LIBRE_KIT_ADF7021 (Config.h) with STM32F103 platform is supported. Please see [BUILD.md](BUILD.md) for pinout details.

If you can't decode any 4FSK modulation (DMR, YSF, P25 or NXDN) with your ZUMspot, the common solution is to adjust RX frequency offset (RXOffset) in your MMDVM.ini file. Please try with steps of +-100 Hz until you get low BER. If you don't have test equipment, the procedure is trial and error. In some cases TXOffset adjustment is also required for proper radio decoding. If you have test equipment, please use [MMDVMCal](https://github.com/g4klx/MMDVMCal).

If you have problems updating firmware using USB bootloader (DFU mode) on Orange Pi or any other system different from RPi, you could compile the dfu tool directly. You could get the source code of a dfu tool [here](https://sourceforge.net/projects/dfu-programmer/files/dfu-programmer/0.7.0/).

For example, download the ZUMspot RPi upgrade script:

    cd ~
    curl -OL https://raw.github.com/juribeparada/MMDVM_HS/master/scripts/install_fw_rpi.sh

make the script executable:

    chmod +x install_fw_rpi.sh

stop your MMDVMHost process and run (you will need the root password):

    ./install_fw_rpi.sh

and wait to complete the upgrading process.

You could optionally install a beta firmware for testing:

    ./install_fw_rpi.sh beta


### Build from the sources ###

You could use example files from `MMDVM_HS/configs` folder and overwrite the `Config.h` file, in order to compile a firmware with default settings. There are a specific config file for each ZUMspot or any MMDVM_HS compatible boards. In general, there are two possible compilation ways:

- Boards with USB interface:

Boards with `STM32_USB_HOST` option enabled in `Config.h` (ZUMspot Libre Kit, ZUMspot USB, GIBSpot USB, NanoDV USB, etc). Those boards need to have the USB bootloader installed. For example:

    make clean
    make bl
    make dfu

You can optionally install a firmware without bootloader, with USB support. Be aware you will need always a ST-Link or serial interface in order to install or update the firmware. For this reason, you should use USB bootloader, unless you have trouble with the bootloader.

    make clean
    make nobl
    make stlink-nobl

- Boards with GPIO interface:

Boards with STM32_USART1_HOST option enabled in Config.h (ZUMspot RPi, MMDVM_HS_Hat, MMDVM_HS_Dual_Hat, Nano hotSPOT, etc). No USB bootloader needed. For example:

    make clean
    make
    make zumspot-pi
